Backing Ukraine Against Russia

The Backing Ukraine Against Russia: Global Support and Munitions microlearning lesson serves as the cornerstone of the Russo Ukrainian War curriculum. For purposes of this lesson we are focusing on Munitions. Next week’s lesson will focus on Training.

As a point in time, this lesson reflects on the war one year after Russia’s brutal invasion and the commencement of Ukraine’s monumental resistance. Supportive insights are provided by two renowned experts: Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl and Counselor to the Secretary of State Derek Chollet. This microlearning lesson serves as a foundation to prompt further lessons in arming of Ukraine, sanctions, choices about certain platforms and munitions, China, India, America’s staying power, and much more.
