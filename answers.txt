Teacher: Certainly. The Wagner Group is a private military company (PMC) believed to be sponsored by the Russian state. It's thought to serve several purposes for Russia. Firstly, it allows the Russian government to engage in military activities indirectly, avoiding official involvement and potential international criticism.
Teacher: It's unlikely. While the Wagner Group has influence, it's predominantly military, not political. It operates in the shadows, and its leaders lack the public political support usually necessary to become a national leader. Furthermore, Russia's political structure and constitution determine the line of succession. If President Putin were to be overthrown, there are established mechanisms for determining his successor. It's important to distinguish between influence and direct political power.
Teacher: Correct. The Ukraine conflict has certainly increased the visibility and operational experience of the Wagner Group, but it doesn't necessarily translate to political power within Russia. The group's role is mostly operational and tactical, being deployed in conflict zones where the Russian government prefers not to have an official presence. This is very different from holding political power within the domestic landscape of Russia.
Teacher: Recent developments indicate escalating tensions between the Wagner Group and the Russian army. The Wagner Group detained a Russian officer who allegedly fired on a Wagner vehicle while intoxicated, due to personal animosity​1​. The group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has criticized Russia's military leadership and claimed that the Russian army mined the roads Wagner used to exit the city of Bakhmut​1​. Prigozhin further stated that the Russian army lost control of some positions around Bakhmut, describing this as a "disgrace"​1​. The Wagner Group had led the fight for Bakhmut, which turned into the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. After claiming full control of the city, they intended to transfer control to the Russian army​1​. This situation, however, has strained their relationship with Russia's defense ministry, as evidenced by their reported massive losses in the battle for Bakhmut​1​.
